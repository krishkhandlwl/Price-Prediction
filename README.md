# Price-Prediction


This GitHub repository focuses on predicting house prices using Python, with a primary emphasis on Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. The project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for predicting house prices based on relevant features.

1.Dataset Handling with Pandas: Leverage the power of Pandas for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and feature engineering. The code demonstrates how to load, explore, and preprocess the dataset to enhance the model's predictive performance.

2.Matplotlib Visualizations: Explore insightful visualizations using Matplotlib to gain a better understanding of the dataset and the relationships between different features. Visualization techniques help in identifying patterns and outliers, contributing to informed decision-making during the model-building process.

3.Machine Learning Model: While the main focus is on Pandas and Matplotlib, a simple machine learning model is incorporated to predict house prices. The model is trained on the preprocessed data, and the code provides a clear walkthrough of the training process.

How to Use:

Clone the repository.

Install the necessary Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib).

Follow the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to understand the data preprocessing, visualization, and model training steps.
